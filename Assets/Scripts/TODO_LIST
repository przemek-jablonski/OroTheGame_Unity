IMPLFIX: change bullet (and not only bullet) collision detection system
	(collisions by raycasts)

IMPLFIX: implement fading (and eventually destroying and deleting) SplashBoxes
	(for optimisation sake - too much triangles to render)

IMPLFIX: MOUSE MOVEMENT (LOOKING IN MOUSE DIRECTION) NEEDS TO BE FIXED
	(not translating properly)

IMPLFIX: StartCoroutine(Coroutine) INSTEAD OF StartCoroutine(“Coroutine”)

FIX: in BulletScript.CheckRaycastCollision():
		this.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity.magnitude is called every frame which fucking sucks 
		(cannot be instantiated in Start() since on moment of birth there is 
		no force attached, it is added 1 frame later ;/)

FIX: in BulletScript.BulletCollided():
		seeking hit gameobject through ComponentList TWICE is unacceptable

FIXX: enemy bleeding from wrong side (from back-side, not spawning on front)

IMPLEMENT: 3 splashes (enemy, bullet, woodbox) needs to inherit common functionality from one parent class

+ Actors hit by bullet must 
	a) Be coloured red for few seconds
	b) maybe shake a little (mainly in -shotVector)
	c) have FLOATING DMG NUMBER
	d) must be killed (deleted for now, later DEATH ANIMATION)

FLOATING DMG NUMBER:
	a) size depends on how many dmg was dealt
	b) colour depends on how many HP has actor got left

FICZER: blood stains on hit
	(flowing in the air)
	(spilling on the ground on hit)
