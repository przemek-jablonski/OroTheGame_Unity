IMPLFIX: change bullet (and not only bullet) collision detection system
	(collisions by raycasts)

IMPLFIX: implement fading (and eventually destroying and deleting) SplashBoxes
	(for optimisation sake - too much triangles to render)

IMPLFIX: MOUSE MOVEMENT (LOOKING IN MOUSE DIRECTION) NEEDS TO BE FIXED
	(not translating properly)

IMPLFIX: StartCoroutine(Coroutine) INSTEAD OF StartCoroutine(“Coroutine”)


+ Actors hit by bullet must 
	a) Be coloured red for few seconds
	b) maybe shake a little (mainly in -shotVector)
	c) have FLOATING DMG NUMBER
	d) must be killed (deleted for now, later DEATH ANIMATION)

FLOATING DMG NUMBER:
	a) size depends on how many dmg was dealt
	b) colour depends on how many HP has actor got left

FICZER: blood stains on hit
	(flowing in the air)
	(spilling on the ground on hit)
